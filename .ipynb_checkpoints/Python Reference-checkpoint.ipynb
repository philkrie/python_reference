    "When you run a python program, each line gets passed through the Python Interpreter, the version of which depends on what you're using (this notebook uses Python 3.5). To be more specific, the python code is compiled into byte code, which is then sent to the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), or the execution engine of the Python Interpreter. The byte code is sometimes stored in .pyc files for later use. Unlike C or C++, there is no 'build' or 'make' step. As a result of this architecture, Python is neither as slow as traditional interpreted languages nor as fast as a traditional compiled language."
